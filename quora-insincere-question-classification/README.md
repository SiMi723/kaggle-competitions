# Quora Insincere Question Classification ðŸ§ 

This project is part of a Kaggle competition where the goal is to detect **toxic or insincere questions** from Quora's question dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did

- Explored the dataset using pandas
- Preprocessed text data (tokenization, lowercasing, etc.)
- Applied a **Bag-of-Words** model for feature extraction
- Trained classification models to identify insincere questions
