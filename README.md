# 🏆 Kaggle Competitions – Personal Practice & Projects

This repository contains my personal solutions and learnings from various Kaggle competitions. I’m using these challenges to apply machine learning techniques, improve my model-building skills, and explore real-world datasets through hands-on implementation.
